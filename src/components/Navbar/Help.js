                <h3>What is the best insurance solution for a fire incident?</h3>
                <p className="d-flex ">Home Insurance typically helps cover your home and belongings. Most policies include coverages that may help pay to repair or replace your home and its contents if they are damaged by fire. Your house is probably the most valuable asset you have, and you have homeowners insurance to help protect you and your house in case something unfortunate, such as a fire, should happen. From electrical issues to candle mishaps, the National Fire Protection Association reports an average of 346,800 residential fires each year. </p>
